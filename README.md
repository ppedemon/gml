## GML: A minimalistic Haskell ray tracer

This is my implementation of the ray tracer specified by third ICFP contest.
You can see the details [here](http://www.cs.cornell.edu/icfp/task.htm).

I didn't participate in the contest (there's no way I could implement this in
just three days!). The code here is just a Haskell port of the submission awarded
with the second prize, by team Caml R'us (if I remember correctly). The reasons
for doing this were twofold: (1) to teach me how to implement a ray tracer, and
(2) to learn Ocaml. Indeed, this project was my first serious attempt at 
understanding a non trivial OCaml code-base.

I implemented the ray tracer in my spare time during 2002. I don't even remember 
the ghc version that I used for this. Needless to say, this won't compile in a 
modern ghc version. Alhgough the port should be easy, I have better things to do.
I'm just putting this here in github just for preserving the things I crafted in 
the good days.
